<h1>Joshua Y.-L. Jones</h1>

<div>
<p>I have just completed Part III in DAMTP at the University of Cambridge, taking courses on theoretical physics. I was previously at Imperial College London.
  I am particularly interested in fundamental physics, particularly on the quantum field theory side of things. At Cambridge, I wrote my Part III Essay for David Tong,
  whilst at Imperial, I carried out my final project under the supervision of Yasaman K. Yazdi. I have also been doing some work outside of my formal education with Job Feldbrugge,
  who is at the Edinburgh University.</p>
<br />
 
<p>Generically, the better the physicist, the worse their website looks. I live in hope.</p>
