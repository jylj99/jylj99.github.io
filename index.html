<p>I am a phD student at the Dublin Institute for Advanced studies, under the supervision of Yasaman Yazdi.
   Before that, I completed Part III in DAMTP at the University of Cambridge, taking courses on theoretical physics.
   Before that, I was an undergrad at Imperial College London.
  <br />
  <br />
  I am interested in fundamental physics, particularly on the quantum field theory side of things. At Cambridge, I wrote my Part III Essay for David Tong.
  At Imperial, I carried out my final project under the supervision of Yasaman Yazdi. I have also been doing some work outside of my formal education with Job Feldbrugge,
  who is at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<br />

<p>Generically, the better the physicist, the worse their website looks. I live in hope.</p>
