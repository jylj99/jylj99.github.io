<h1>Research</h1> 
<p>Here I have written some brief explanations of research, both original and not, that I have done.</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2>Non-Ergodic Billiards</h2>
<p><em>Under the supervision of Dmitry Turaev</em></p>
<br />
<p>This was a project wherein I looked at the way the non-ergodicity of a dynamical billiard could lead to unbounded energy gain.</p>
<br />
<br />
 
<h2>Entanglement Entropy in Causal Set Theory</h2>
<p><em>Under the supervision of Yasaman Yazdi</em></p>
<br />
<p>This was a project on causal set theory, a theory of discretised spacetime. I studied a covariant entanglement entropy definition, wherein the entanglement entropy is not defined relative to some Cauchy hypersurface.</p>
<br />
<br />
 
<h2>Picard-Lefschetz Theory</h2>
<p><em>Under the supervision of Job Feldbrugge</em></p>
<br />
<p>This is the project I am currently working on, studying the usage of Picard-Lefschetz theory to define real time path integrals, avoiding the use of a Wick rotation.</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2>Seiberg-Witten Theory</h2>
<p><em>Under the supervision of David Tong</em></p>
<br />
<p>This was the topic in which I wrote my part III essay, which was about the Seiberg-Witten solution to Seiberg-Witten theory. I covered preliminary and neccessary topics to understand the solution, such as solitonic solutions in gauge theory, and the basics of elliptic curves. I also briefly went on to cover how the Seiberg-Witten solution gives rise to confinement, which is the only known analytic means by which we have confinement within a quantum field theory.</p>
